Predicting Term Deposit Signups with Bank Data</title><link>https://just1a2noob.github.io/Portofolio-Website/posts/svm_linear/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:12:46 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://just1a2noob.github.io/Portofolio-Website/posts/svm_linear/</guid><description>This project is created with the intention of fulfiling my curiosity. Some of the questions that I hope that I can answer by doing this project is:
What type of person is interested in subscribing to a term deposit? With the assumption of using just calls to tell them about term deposit, is the action of just calling enough to persuade them? If it is enough what is the minimum time needed to know we have somewhat persuaded the person? Between Logistic Regression and Support Machine Vector, which one is better? The dataset that I am gona use is from a Portuguese banking institution marketing campaign. The goal of this dataset is to classify if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The original format of this file is .arff format which is suitable for machine learning and easier for machines to read.</description></item><item><title>Imbalanced Dataset: Learning from Mistakes</title><link>https://just1a2noob.github.io/Portofolio-Website/posts/imbalanced-dataset/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 12:12:46 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://just1a2noob.github.io/Portofolio-Website/posts/imbalanced-dataset/</guid><description>In this post, I will tell you my first experience dealing with imbalanced dataset and a very large dataset while having insufficient resources to process such a large dataset.</description></item></channel></rss>
