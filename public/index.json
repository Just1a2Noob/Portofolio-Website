[{"content":"This project is created with the intention of fulfiling my curiosity. Some of the questions that I hope that I can answer by doing this project is:\nWhat type of person is interested in subscribing to a term deposit? With the assumption of using just calls to tell them about term deposit, is the action of just calling enough to persuade them? If it is enough what is the minimum time needed to know we have somewhat persuaded the person? Between Linear Regression and Support Machine Vector, which one is better? The dataset that I am gona use is from a Portuguese banking institution marketing campaign. The goal of this dataset is to classify if the client will subscribe a term deposit. The original format of this file is .arff format which is suitable for machine learning and easier for machines to read.\nTo keep things simple I\u0026rsquo;m going to use only Linear Regression and Support Machine Vector, another reason why I\u0026rsquo;m using only these models is to learn the workings of both models. At the end I\u0026rsquo;m going to compare its accuracy, to determine which is better. The results of this comparison is quite surprising.\nCleaning Data Take a quick look at the data it\u0026rsquo;s header are named using variables names, V1, V2,... because of this I first changed its headers to its associated description.\nAfter that I changed the last_contact_day and last_contact_month to become one column calling it last_contact_date. The reason for this change is because I found it a bit weird as to why it isn\u0026rsquo;t combined to a single day.\n","date":"April 8, 2025","permalink":"/Portofolio-Website/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"This project is created with the intention of fulfiling my curiosity.
